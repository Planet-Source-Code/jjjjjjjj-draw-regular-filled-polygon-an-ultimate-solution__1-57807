## \[ Draw Regular Filled Polygon \] \- An Ultimate Solution\.


</div>

### Description

This is a 'Draw Polygon' function which can draw a regular-filled Polygon with advanced filling options like 'Filling Bitmap Pattern' .The main importance of this code is that, you need only to specify the 'Side-length' and 'SideLength'.It is not needed to specify all the verticies included. It can draw unlimited sides and can 'Rotate' the polygon about the centre as well as the specified vertex.You can specify the filling color by setting the "FillColor' of the PictureBox. It works smooth and fast. It contains some equations which derived myself.

The 'New Feature' of this update is it's better nine 'Filliling Options'

1. Transparent

2. HorizontalLine

3.VerticalLine

4. UpwardDiagonal

5.DownwardDiogonal

6.Cross

7.DiagonalCross

8. Solid

9.FillBitmap

Its Upto you to Vote for this code. Anyway please don't forget to add your Comments/Feedbacks. Good Luck!
